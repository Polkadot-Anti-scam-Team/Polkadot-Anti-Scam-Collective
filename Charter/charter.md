# Polkadot Anti-scam Collective Charter


## 1. Background
The Polkadot anti-scam team is a collective tasked with protecting the Polkadot community from scams. This is done by incentivizing community members and collaborating with entities to take actions that will help reduce these scam activities and protect the community from them. Scam-fighitng activities of the team include, but not limited to take-down of phishing sites, takedown of social media site, maintenance of phishing repositories, keeping on the watch-out for scam attempts in ecosystem platforms, Anti-scam outreach/education, scam forensics and enhanced due diligence on ecosystem entities.

The scam-fighting initiative has [existed](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadots-anti-scam-initiatives-1660ef5787b7) since 2021. Initialy run by the Web3 Foundation with community participation, the initiative has evolved into a full-fledged team completely run by the community. 

From an administrative stand-point, the Anti-scam team is run by a captain, executive members and senior members. These members are responsible for managing the various anti-scam tracks and tasks, while participating in some of these tasks themselves. The team is currently being funded by [Bounty 11](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/11) whose funds are controlled by a multi-signature proxy membered by 4 General Curators.

## 2. Value Proposition and Mandate
The goal of the anti-scam collective is to onboard the team on-chain, have a decentralized structure for organization and expansion and recognize the efforts of individuals helping (or interesting in helping) fight scam in the ecosystem. This section demonstrates our value proposition and Mandate, which remains the bedrock of our anti-scam activities as a collective.


#### 2.1 Fostering Security and Trust
The expertise and proficiency of our team in detecting and mitigating scams shall prove instrumental in establishing a more secure environment for the ecosystem. By pooling our collective knowledge and resources, we believe that the Anti-scam collective can effectively tackle emerging threats and help maintain the highest standards of security within the ecosystem. 

#### 2.2 Knowledge sharing and collaboration
As a collective, the Anti-scam team will actively engage in collaborative efforts with fellow members and external entities. This includes sharing valuable insights, best practices, and lessons learned from our anti-scam initiatives. 

The team will actively participate in knowledge-sharing, in ensuring that the broader Polkadot community remains informed and vigilant against potential scams

Through joint initiatives, the team will work closely with the community and other collectives to identify emerging trends and create solutions tailored to help address security challenges in the Polkadot ecosystem.

In addition to sharing our own knowledge and expertise, the collective should learn and improve by tapping from the diverse experiences and perspectives of other members. With efficient collaborations, we believe that we can collectively strengthen the Polkadot network's defenses against scams and malicious actors.

#### 2.3 Proactive monitoring and reporting
The Anti-scam collective is tasked with monitoring and reporting potential threats, vulnerabilities, and scams. This will help bring unscrupulous activities to light, consequently making the community aware of (and protecting themselves from) them.

#### 2.4 Innovative solutions that will make project research easier for the community
The Anti-scam team collective is tasked with developing mechanisms to objectively assess projects based on pre-determined metrics. This will make it easier and faster for the community to do their own research. Such solutions are not meant to dismiss or call out projects (unless such projects clearly pose a threat to the community). Rather, it will be aimed at providing objective facts to the community to enable them to make better decisions.
