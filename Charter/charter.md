# Polkadot Anti-scam Collective Charter


## 1. Background
The Polkadot anti-scam team is a collective tasked with protecting the Polkadot community from scams. This is done by incentivizing community members and collaborating with entities to take actions that will help reduce these scam activities and protect the community from them. Scam-fighting activities of the team include, but are not limited to take-down of phishing sites, takedown of social media sites, maintenance of phishing repositories, keeping on the watch-out for scam attempts in ecosystem platforms, Anti-scam outreach/education, scam forensics and enhanced due diligence on ecosystem entities.

The scam-fighting initiative has [existed](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadots-anti-scam-initiatives-1660ef5787b7) since 2021. Initially run by the Web3 Foundation with community participation, the initiative has evolved into a full-fledged team completely run by the community. 

From an administrative standpoint, the Anti-scam team is run by a captain, executive members, and senior members. These members are responsible for managing the various anti-scam tracks and tasks while participating in some of these tasks themselves. The team is currently being funded by [Bounty 11](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/11) whose funds are controlled by a multi-signature proxy membered by 4 General Curators.

## 2. Value Proposition and Mandate
The goal of the anti-scam collective is to onboard the team on-chain, have a decentralized structure for organization and expansion, and recognize the efforts of individuals helping (or interested in helping) fight scams in the ecosystem. This section demonstrates our value proposition and Mandate, which remains the bedrock of our anti-scam activities as a collective.


#### 2.1 Fostering Security and Trust
The expertise and proficiency of our team in detecting and mitigating scams shall prove instrumental in establishing a more secure environment for the ecosystem. By pooling our collective knowledge and resources, we believe that the Anti-scam collective can effectively tackle emerging threats and help maintain the highest standards of security within the ecosystem. 

#### 2.2 Knowledge sharing and collaboration
As a collective, the Anti-scam team will actively engage in collaborative efforts with fellow members and external entities. This includes sharing valuable insights, best practices, and lessons learned from our anti-scam initiatives. 

The team will actively participate in knowledge-sharing, ensuring that the broader Polkadot community remains informed and vigilant against potential scams

Through joint initiatives, the team will work closely with the community and other collectives to identify emerging trends and create solutions tailored to help address security challenges in the Polkadot ecosystem.

In addition to sharing our knowledge and expertise, the collective should learn and improve by tapping from the diverse experiences and perspectives of other members. With efficient collaborations, we believe that we can collectively strengthen the Polkadot network's defenses against scams and malicious actors.

#### 2.3 Proactive monitoring and reporting
The Anti-scam collective is tasked with monitoring and reporting potential threats, vulnerabilities, and scams. This will help bring unscrupulous activities to light, consequently making the community aware of (and protecting themselves from) them.

#### 2.4 Innovative solutions that will make project research easier for the community
The Anti-scam team collective is tasked with developing mechanisms to objectively assess projects based on pre-determined metrics. This will make it easier and faster for the community to do their research. Such solutions are not meant to dismiss or call out projects (unless such projects pose a threat to the community). Rather, it will be aimed at providing objective facts to the community to enable them to make better decisions. 



## 3. Key Tenets of the Anti-Scam Collective
Members are anticipated to dutifully adhere to the established tenets. Any elucidations of the rules should align with and reflect these guiding principles.
- Prioritize transparent and clear communication with the Polkadot community, providing timely updates on emerging threats, preventive measures, and any actions taken by the anti-scam team.
- Cultivate collaborations with other security-focused entities, blockchain projects, and cybersecurity experts to establish a united front against scams, sharing insights and strategies for enhanced collective defense.
- Extend empathetic support to individuals affected by scams, offering resources and guidance for recovery, while working towards the swift resolution of scam-related incidents.
- Foster a culture of awareness and understanding within the community through educational initiatives, empowering users to recognize and avoid scams independently.
- Uphold a continuous and vigilant watch over the Polkadot ecosystem to promptly identify and address potential scams, fraud, or deceptive activities.
- Provide utmost respect to fellow members and the wider community.
- Respect the structure, rules, and other specifics of the Anti-scam collective.

## Summary of Ranks

The Polkadot Anti-Scam Team employs a well-defined hierarchical ranking system, with each level representing a distinct role and level of responsibility. This system is crucial for maintaining order of operations and effective leadership within the collective.

There are 5 ranks in the Anti-scam team: 
- Candidate (Rank 0),
- Member (Rank 1),
- Senior Member (Rank 2),
- Executive Member (Rank 3),
- Captain (Rank 4).
- 
To be considered for promotion, members might need to hold their respective ranks for a specified amount of time. Whilst ideally enforced on-chain, this consideration could also be managed off-chain.

The ranking begins with the Candidates (Rank 0), who lack voting rights initially, but engage in learning about the team's operations and contribute to tasks where necessary. Candidates enter through an off-chain promotion track after a successful vote by the Executive members. 

Members (Rank 1) are full participants in the team, with voting rights, contributing to a chosen track. After a minimum of 6 months at this rank, members may be eligible for promotion to Senior Member.

Senior Members (Rank 2) are recognized as veterans, assuming increased rights and off-chain responsibilities after a minimum of 1 year as a Member. 

Executive Members (Rank 3) serve as on-chain representatives, requiring a commitment of at least 1 year as a Senior Member before assuming Rank 3. The collective may wish to incorporate a rotational process, where one or more executive members may be demoted back to Rank 2 after 6 months. The Executive Team's composition emphasizes expertise, agility, and careful promotion considerations.

The pinnacle of leadership is Rank 4, The Captain of the Anti-scam Team and the off-chain representative, held by a single member. The Captain assumes promotion from Executive Member to Captain, typically held for 6 months. A regular referendum is raised every 6 months to evaluate leadership for this rank. Only failed demotion referenda extend the "term," while successful ones prompt the promotion of a new Captain.

This hierarchical structure ensures a dynamic and responsive collective model, balancing the need for experience, commitment, and periodic evaluation within the Polkadot Anti-Scam Team.


## Details of Individual Ranks

The Polkadot Anti-scam team, aimed at protecting the Polkadot community from scams, can be seen as an organization as it is well structured. Like any other team/organization, the Polkadot Anti-scam team is composed of members with various hierarchies (Ranks), ranging from Candidates to Captain. Members can be Curators and/or Implementers.

### Candidate (Rank 0)
The candidates are community users who have demonstrated an interest in being part of the Anti-scam team. The candidate follows along and takes part in activities similar to members and stands the chance of being promoted to “Member” upon fulfillment of constituted criteria for full membership. 

The motion for promotion of active candidates in the community is raised and confirmed in the promotion track. Rank 0 has no voting rights and cannot apply to become a Track manager, Executive member, or Captain.

### Member (Rank 1)
This rank consists of members who have just been accepted into the Anti-scam team. 
Members of the Polkadot Anti-scam team are stakeholders in that they perform crucial functions, including but not limited to implementing tasks, assisting the Captain, Executive team, and Senior Member in deliberating and fine-tuning decisions, Child bounty curation, strategizing ways to expand the Anti-scam team initiatives, participating in voting, and may also participate in task management.

### Senior Member (Rank 2)
Senior members are experienced members of the Anti-scam team. Any member from this rank can apply to take responsibilities for various initiatives such as curation of the Anti-scam dashboard (Task management), admission/onboarding of new members into the team, mapping out educational campaigns that expand on Task 7 (track management), and by extension, other tracks in the initiative, Child bounty curation, and more. 
Rank 2 has an increased power in voting and can apply for the position of Executive team or Captain with increased rights and (off-chain) responsibilities.

### Executive Member (Rank 3)
The Executive Members, as the name implies, assist the Captain in making and executing decisions. Rank 3 participates in other crucial activities like Track management, Task management, Child bounty curation, etc. 
The Executive members serve as the on-chain representatives of the Collective and are responsible for the initiation of referenda in the Treasury. They can apply for the position of Captain and vote in the Executive track (along with the Captain) and can issue extrinsics to vote in other collectives. 
Given that expertise is needed to perform these tasks, plus the fact that the Executive Team should be agile, the members that hold that rank should be small in number, and serious consideration should be given before promoting another member to this rank. 

### Captain (Rank 4)
Unlike other ranks where more than one individual is involved, only a single member can hold Rank 4. The Captain, being the leader of the Anti-scam team and its off-chain representative, is responsible for collaborating with the team to set goals and mapping out proper plans regarding the future course of the achievement of these goals. 

The Captain collaborates with the team to organize/expand the initiative by identifying, grouping, assigning, and coordinating Anti-scam activities. The Captain represents the team in external settings and should ideally be the Track manager of the Administrative/Operations track and may be required to specifically manage some specific tasks when necessary.
