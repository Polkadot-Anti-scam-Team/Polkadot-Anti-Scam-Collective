This is done by incentivizing community members and collaborating with entities to take actions that will help reduce these scam activities and protect the community from them. Scam-fighitng activities of the team include, but not limited to take-down of phishing sites, takedown of social media site, maintenance of phishing repositories, keeping on the watch-out for scam attempts in ecosystem platforms, Anti-scam outreach/education, scam forensics and enhanced due diligence on ecosystem entities.

The scam-fighting initiative has [existed](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadots-anti-scam-initiatives-1660ef5787b7) since 2021. Initialy run by the Web3 Foundation with community participation, the initiative has evolved into a full-fledged team completely run by the community. 

From an administrative stand-point, the Anti-scam team is run by a captain, executive members and senior members. These members are responsible for managing the various anti-scam tracks and tasks, while participating in some of these tasks themselves. The team is currently being funded by [Bounty 11](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/11) whose funds are controlled by a multi-signature proxy membered by 4 General Curators.
